## QuickSort

Quicksort is a very effective sorting algorithm that employs divide and conquer strategy to sort elements.

It works by choosing a pivot element and then recursively applying quicksort to each half, both left and right. 

**Time complexity**:\
Best case: $O(nlogn)$ \
Worst case: $O(n^2)$
